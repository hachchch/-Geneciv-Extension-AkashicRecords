The term was originally coined by Charles Darwin in an 1871 letter to his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker. This idea is related to later work such as the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis and the Miller–Urey experiment, which respectively provided a hypothesis for life’s origin from a primordial soup of organics and a proof of concept for the mechanism by which biomolecules and their precursors may have formed.",
